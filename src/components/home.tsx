        <p>
          I'm a frontend developer with a law degree and a deep passion for
          clean, functional, and scalable web solutions. Over the past 9+ years,
          Iâ€™ve worked on a variety of complex platforms (from telecom,
          e-commerce, business, entertainment, blog to radio streaming apps)
          mostly in cross-functional teams across Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy translating design systems into pixelPerfect reusable
          components, optimizing performance, and making sure everything runs
          smoothly on both technical and human levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          I thrive on problem-solving, performance optimization, and developing
          reusable, scalable components that ensure a seamless user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work has directly contributed to faster page loads, improved
          accessibility, and increased user engagement.
        </p>

      <ScrollDown />
